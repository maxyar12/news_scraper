This is a beautifulsoup based news content scraping and aggregation code.
It also connects to a database for storage.
This code can be set to run by itself on linux based systems. It is similar to what google news, does, but just a much more simplified, narrow version
based on our old cancernews.org site which is now defunct. This uses some natural language processing.
